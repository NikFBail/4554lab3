1. The 1-bit error in ECB gave us:
iNspector
So one block was changed from a lowercase char to it's
equivalent uppercase char

2. The 1-bit error in CBC gave us:
1vZICc|or
Most of the original plaintext was changed,
with only the last two blocks ('or') staying the same

3. The 1-bit error in CFB gave us:
☻mvgqcuor
Similar result as in CBC, all the plaintext was
changed except for the last two ('or').
It's also interesting that the first char became an emoji

4. The 1-bit error in OFB gave us:
☻ewgq.E_
This time the entire plaintext was changed, and the
emoji is back. Also, the plaintext was originally 9 char long,
while the decrypted 1-bit error returned a 8 char string,
unless the last one is a space.

5. The 1-bit error in CTR gave us:

ee▬r
While only 4 char are visible, a new line was put in for one
of the first blocks in the 1-bit error. This is the most
noticeably different 1-bit error, as there is formatting introduced,
as well as only 4 visible chars (not visible changes, visible letters/symbols).
